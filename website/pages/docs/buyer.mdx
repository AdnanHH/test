# Buyer's guide for the payment gateway system

Decentralized payment gateway systems offer a secure and transparent way for buyers to make payments and for sellers to receive payments. In a typical decentralized payment gateway system, the buyer pays upfront before the product is ordered. The payment is then stored in a temporary pool until the delivery of the product.

Once the product is delivered, the buyer scans a QR code provided by the delivery boy, which releases the funds from the temporary pool to the seller. This ensures that the seller receives payment only after the product has been successfully delivered to the buyer, which reduces the risk of fraud and disputes.

The use of blockchain technology in decentralized payment gateway systems allows for greater security and transparency in transactions. Blockchain technology ensures that transactions are recorded on a distributed ledger that cannot be altered, which reduces the risk of fraudulent activities. Additionally, since the transactions are transparent and can be viewed by all parties involved, there is less room for disputes and misunderstandings.

Overall, the buyer side of a decentralized payment gateway system offers a secure and efficient way for buyers to make payments while ensuring that sellers receive payment only after the product has been successfully delivered to the buyer. The use of blockchain technology in these systems provides greater security and transparency, which reduces the risk of fraud and disputes.
