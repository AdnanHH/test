# Getting started 

    
The payment system has always been a crucial part of any transaction, whether it be online or offline. However, the traditional payment gateway system has several issues, which include middlemen interference, lack of transparency, and security issues. These issues have resulted in scams and frauds, which affect the users' trust in online payment systems.
To overcome these problems, we have introduced a new payment gateway system based on DeFi (Decentralized Finance) and blockchain technology. This system aims to reduce the number of scams that occur daily due to false promises made by online sellers. Our payment gateway system provides security, transparency, and quick refunds to the users.
