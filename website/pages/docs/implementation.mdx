# Implementation
## Implementation in Ecommerce website
Our payment gateway system is unique compared to traditional payment gateway systems, as it uses a temporary pool to store the money transferred by customers. This ensures that customers do not get scammed, as in the case of a fake product or if the product does not arrive within the specified timeframe in the smart contract, the seller does not get paid. Instead, the money is refunded back to the customer within the timeframe specified in our system. E-commerce websites can benefit from using our payment gateway system as it provides an additional layer of security for their customers, reducing the risk of fraud and increasing customer trust.
## Implementation in Charity organization
Our payment gateway system can be implemented in charity organizations as a safe and reliable way to donate money to people in need. By using our system, donors can have a transparent and secure way of transferring funds directly to the intended recipients, without any middlemen interference. The blockchain technology used in our system ensures that every transaction made is recorded and can be tracked by the donor, enabling them to ensure that the money reaches the people it was intended for.
