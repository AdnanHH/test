# Objectives
Our payment gateway system aims to solve the trust issues between two entities by using decentralized networks and cryptographic protocols. We use the Ethereum blockchain to leverage DeFi, which eliminates the need for third-party interference during the transaction of a large sum of money.

We also aim to return money quickly to the sender in case of a refund. Our users can get refunds within minutes if they find that the product is not genuine or that they no longer require the product. The money is stored in a temporary pool, which is instantly reverted back to the buyer's account.

Our payment gateway system is transparent, and users can access the decentralized ledger to track the details of transactions made via the gateway system. Moreover, our payment gateway system is secure as we use decentralized networks and cryptographic protocols.
