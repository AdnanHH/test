# Delivery boy's guide for the payment gateway system
A decentralized payment gateway system is a secure and transparent way for buyers to pay for products they purchase on e-commerce websites. Here is a step-by-step guide for delivery boys to use a decentralized payment gateway system:

# Receive the product for delivery
The delivery boy must first receive the product for delivery from the seller. The delivery boy must ensure that the product is genuine and that it matches the description provided by the seller.

# Deliver the product
The delivery boy must then deliver the product to the buyer at the specified location and time.

# Scan the QR code
The delivery boy must then provide the buyer with a QR code, which the buyer must scan to confirm the receipt of the product.

# Wait for confirmation
The delivery boy must wait for the buyer to confirm the receipt of the product and the genuineness of the product.

# Release of funds
Once the buyer confirms the receipt of the product and its genuineness, the buyer will be prompted to release the funds from the temporary pool. The delivery boy must ensure that the buyer scans the QR code and confirms the release of funds.

# Confirm the release of funds
After the buyer confirms the release of funds, the delivery boy must confirm that the funds can be released from the temporary pool to the seller's account. This confirmation can be done through the decentralized payment gateway system, which will ensure that the funds are transferred securely and transparently.

# Collect the payment
Once the funds are released, the delivery boy can collect the payment from the seller.
Using a decentralized payment gateway system provides delivery boys with a secure and transparent way to collect payment for the products they deliver. By following these simple steps, delivery boys can ensure that they receive payment safely and that they provide excellent customer service to buyers.
