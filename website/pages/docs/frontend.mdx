# Front-end Development

The front-end of our payment gateway system includes a user interface that allows users to log in with Metamask, browse products, and make payments for our e-commeeerce website. It also displays transaction details and provides access to the decentralized ledger, which records transactions between parties in a secure and transparent manner.
We also develop front-end for a charity organization to integrate our payment gateway system into,to display the use-case for our payment gateway system in charity organizations.
Next.js is used to build the front-end of our payment gateway system, as it provides an efficient and effective way to develop user interfaces for web applications.Next.js is a React-based open-source framework used for building server-side rendering (SSR) web applications. It is built on top of Node.js, which provides the capability of server-side rendering to Next.js. We also use CSS to style our website and make it visually appealing to users.
