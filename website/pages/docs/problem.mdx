# Problem Statement
The problem that our payment gateway system aims to solve is the lack of security and transparency in traditional payment gateway systems. Many payment gateway systems are centralized, which means that they are controlled by a single entity, such as a bank or a payment processor. This centralized control creates a single point of failure, and if this point is compromised, it could lead to fraudulent activities, such as theft of funds, identity theft, and unauthorized transactions.

Moreover, traditional payment gateway systems lack transparency. Donors or customers do not have a clear idea of where their money is being transferred, and if the money has reached the intended recipients. This lack of transparency creates a trust deficit, and donors may become hesitant to donate money, which could have a negative impact on charitable causes and ecommerce websites.

Our payment gateway system solves these issues by using blockchain technology. Blockchain technology is decentralized, which means that it is not controlled by a single entity. Instead, it is a network of computers that collectively validate and record transactions. This decentralization eliminates the single point of failure, making it more secure than traditional payment gateway systems.

Moreover, our payment gateway system provides transparency by allowing donors and customers to track their transactions on the blockchain. This transparency creates trust, and donors and customers can be sure that their money has reached the intended recipients.
