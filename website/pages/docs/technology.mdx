# Technologies used
## Smart contract
We used smart contracts to execute transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller written directly into code, thus ensuring transparency and trust in the transaction process.
## Ethereum Blockchain
We utilized the decentralized, open-source Ethereum blockchain with smart contract functionality as the backbone of our payment gateway system. Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the platform, was used for transactions.
## Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
Our payment gateway system is built on the principles of decentralized finance (DeFi), which eliminates the need for centralized banking systems and promotes peer-to-peer transactions, thus reducing fees for using financial services.
## Hardhat
We utilized Hardhat, a development environment for Ethereum software, to create a complete development environment. This includes components for editing, compiling, debugging and deploying smart contracts and DApps.
