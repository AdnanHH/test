# Back-end Development

The back end of our payment gateway system is built using the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing digital contracts that are programmed to automatically perform certain actions when specific conditions are met.
In our system, when a customer initiates a payment for a product, the money is stored in a temporary pool until the product is delivered to the customer. This is done by creating a smart contract that specifies the conditions for the transfer of the money. Once the customer receives the product and verifies its authenticity, they can sign the smart contract and release the funds to the seller. If the product is not genuine, the customer can initiate a refund and the funds will be returned to them from the temporary pool.
All of these transactions are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, which is a decentralized and transparent ledger that ensures the security and immutability of the transactions. The use of blockchain and smart contracts eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries, reduces transaction costs, and provides a high level of security and transparency to the users of our payment gateway system.
