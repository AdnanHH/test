Seller's Guide for Using Decentralized Payment Gateway System

A decentralized payment gateway system is a secure and transparent way for sellers to receive payments from buyers. In a typical decentralized payment gateway system, the seller posts the product on the e-commerce website, and the buyer pays for the product using the decentralized payment gateway system. Here is a step-by-step guide for sellers to use a decentralized payment gateway system:

# Post the product on the e-commerce website
The seller must first post the product on the e-commerce website, providing all relevant details such as the product description, price, and shipping options.

# Receive notification of payment
Once the buyer pays for the product using the decentralized payment gateway system, the seller will receive a notification of the payment. However, the money will not be credited to the seller's account immediately.

# Funds stored in temporary pool
Instead, the funds will be stored in a temporary pool in the blockchain until the buyer receives the product and verifies its genuineness.

# Deliver the product
The seller must then deliver the product to the buyer as per the shipping options chosen by the buyer during the purchase process.

# Verification of the product
Once the buyer receives the product, they must verify its genuineness. If the product is found to be genuine, the buyer can proceed with the next step.

# Release of funds
The buyer must then scan a QR code provided by the delivery boy, which will release the funds from the temporary pool into the seller's account. This ensures that the seller receives payment only after the buyer has received the product and verified its genuineness.

In conclusion, a decentralized payment gateway system provides a secure and efficient way for sellers to receive payments from buyers. By following the above steps, sellers can ensure that they receive payment only after the buyer has received the product and verified its genuineness, which reduces the risk of fraud and disputes.
